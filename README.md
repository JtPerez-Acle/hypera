## 🔥 Introduction

HyperA is in active development—laying the groundwork for a new era of codebase understanding. Our goal is crystal clear: build a system capable of understanding code at a level surpassing human comprehension. Whether you're automating code reviews, security analysis, or performance optimization, HyperA is built to unravel complexity and deliver clarity.

## 🎯 Project Vision

HyperA is designed to redefine codebase intelligence by:

- 📌 Understanding the Unseen – Capturing every nuance: from syntax and structure to module interconnections and data flows.
- 🤖 Harnessing AI at Scale – Using Gemini 1.5 Pro for retrieval and context handling and DeepSeek R1 for deep reasoning and inference.
- 🔍 Integrating Rich Metadata – Embedding AST fragments, function signatures, dependency graphs, and performance metrics.
- 💡 Delivering Actionable Insights – Recommending refactoring strategies, security patches, and performance enhancements—tailored to your codebase.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🔎 Advanced Code Analysis – Deep semantic and structural analysis of codebases.
- 🌍 Multi-Language Support – Native support for Python, Rust, TypeScript, and more via AST-based universal representation.
- ⚡ Scalable Vector Storage – Powered by Qdrant, ensuring fast and efficient vector search.
- 🔗 RAG-Driven Retrieval & Reasoning – Seamless retrieval (Gemini 1.5 Pro) + reasoning (DeepSeek R1) for precise, context-aware insights.
- 🛡 Automated Code Reviews & Security Analysis – Identifies vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and best practices.
- 📦 Modular, Extensible Architecture – Designed for scalability, flexibility, and integration into any development workflow.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

### HyperA's architecture is designed for scalability, modularity, and high-performance retrieval and analysis. It follows a structured, multi-stage pipeline that ensures every component is optimized for efficiency and insight extraction.
