# HyperA Development Plan

## Project Vision

Build a hyper-human codebase understanding system that leverages advanced retrieval and deep reasoning to capture every nuance of code. Our architecture uses **Gemini 1.5 Pro** as a pure retrieval and context-holding engine, feeding enriched context to **DeepSeek R1** for enhanced reasoning. The system will integrate rich metadata and scalable vector storage (Qdrant) to achieve robust, scalable, and future-proof analysis.
